    "Q1: What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Filter method is a feature selection technique that evaluates the relevance of features independently of the machine learning model. It works by calculating statistical metrics (e.g., correlation, mutual information, chi-squared) between each feature and the target variable. Features with the highest scores are selected."

    "Q2: How does the Wrapper method differ from the Filter method in feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wrapper method selects features by training and evaluating multiple machine learning models using different subsets of features. It involves iterative model training, typically using techniques like forward selection, backward elimination, or recursive feature elimination (RFE). Wrapper methods consider the interaction between features and directly optimize the model's performance."
