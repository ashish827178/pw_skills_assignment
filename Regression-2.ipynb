    " Q1. Explain the concept of R-squared in linear regression models. How is it calculated, and what does it represent?\n",
    " \n",
    " Answer:\n",
    " R-squared (coefficient of determination) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in a regression model. It is calculated as the ratio of the explained variance to the total variance of the dependent variable. R-squared values range from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the model does not explain any variance in the dependent variable, and 1 indicates that the model explains all the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is useful because it provides a measure of how well the independent variables explain the variation in the dependent variable. A high R-squared value indicates that the independent variables are effective in explaining the variation, while a low R-squared value indicates that the model may not be a good fit for the data."

    "Q2. Define adjusted R-squared and explain how it differs from the regular R-squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared is a modification of R-squared that adjusts for the number of independent variables in the model. It penalizes the addition of unnecessary variables that do not significantly improve the fit of the model. Adjusted R-squared is calculated as 1 - [(1 - R-squared) * (n - 1) / (n - p - 1)], where n is the number of observations and p is the number of independent variables in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared is particularly useful when comparing models with different numbers of independent variables. It provides a more accurate measure of the goodness of fit by penalizing the inclusion of unnecessary variables. A higher adjusted R-squared value indicates a better fit of the model to the data."

    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared is more appropriate to use when comparing models with different numbers of independent variables. While R-squared tends to increase with the addition of more variables, adjusted R-squared takes into account the number of variables in the model and penalizes the addition of variables that do not improve the model's fit. Thus, adjusted R-squared provides a more reliable measure of the model's goodness of fit in such cases."

    "RMSE is the square root of the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. It provides a measure of the average error of the model's predictions, with larger errors weighted more heavily.\n",
    "MSE is the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. It is a measure of the average squared error of the model's predictions, providing a measure of the overall model accuracy.\n",
    "MAE is the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values. It provides a measure of the average absolute error of the model's predictions, giving equal weight to all errors regardless of size."

    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "RMSE, MSE, and MAE are widely used as evaluation metrics in regression analysis due to their simplicity and ease of interpretation. They provide a quantitative measure of the model's accuracy and can be used to compare different models. However, these metrics do not capture the direction of errors (overestimation vs. underestimation) and may be sensitive to outliers in the data, which can affect their reliability in certain cases."

    "Q6. Explain the concept of Lasso regularization. How does it differ from Ridge regularization, and when is it more appropriate to use?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Lasso regularization is a regularization technique used in linear regression to penalize the absolute size of the coefficients. It differs from Ridge regularization in that it can shrink some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing variable selection. Lasso regularization is more appropriate when there is a need to reduce the number of features in the model, as it can automatically select the most relevant features and remove irrelevant ones."

    "Q7. How do regularized linear models help to prevent overfitting in machine learning? Provide an example to illustrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Regularized linear models help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function that discourages large coefficients. This penalty term encourages the model to choose simpler models with smaller coefficients, reducing the risk of overfitting. For example, in Lasso regularization, the penalty term is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients, which can shrink coefficients to zero and effectively remove irrelevant features from the model."

    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    " While regularized linear models are effective in preventing overfitting and improving the generalization of the model, they have some limitations. One limitation is the need to choose the appropriate regularization parameter, which can be challenging and may require tuning. Additionally, regularized models may not perform well when the number of features is much larger than the number of observations or when there is multicollinearity among the independent variables, as these factors can affect the stability and interpretability of the model."

    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "In this case, Model B would be chosen as the better performer because it has a lower MAE, indicating that it has smaller errors on average compared to Model A. However, it is important to consider the specific context and requirements of the problem, as different metrics may be more appropriate depending on the goals of the analysis. Additionally, it is important to consider the limitations of each metric, such as sensitivity to outliers or the direction of errors."

    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "In this scenario, the choice between Ridge regularization (Model A) and Lasso regularization (Model B) would depend on the specific requirements of the problem. Ridge regularization tends to shrink all coefficients towards zero, while Lasso regularization can lead to sparsity by setting some coefficients to exactly zero. If feature selection is important, Lasso regularization may be preferred. However, there may be trade-offs in terms of model complexity and interpretability, as Lasso regularization can result in a more complex model with fewer features.\n",
