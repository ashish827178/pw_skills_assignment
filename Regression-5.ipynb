    "Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression is a regularization technique that combines the penalties of both Ridge Regression (L2 regularization) and Lasso Regression (L1 regularization). It differs from other regression techniques by offering a balance between Ridge and Lasso, allowing for variable selection while handling multicollinearity."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal values of the regularization parameters (alpha and l1_ratio) for Elastic Net Regression are typically chosen using cross-validation. Grid search or randomized search can be used to explore different combinations of alpha and l1_ratio values and select the ones that result in the best model performance."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients in Elastic Net Regression can be interpreted similarly to those in linear regression. However, due to the regularization penalties, the coefficients may be shrunk towards zero or set to exactly zero, indicating that the corresponding features are not important for the model."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing values can be handled in Elastic Net Regression by imputing them with the mean, median, or mode of the respective feature. Alternatively, advanced imputation techniques such as K-nearest neighbors (KNN) or predictive imputation can be used."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression can be used for feature selection by examining the magnitude of the coefficients. Features with non-zero coefficients are considered important for the model, while features with zero coefficients can be considered less important and potentially excluded from the model."
