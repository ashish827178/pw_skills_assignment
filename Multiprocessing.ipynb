    "Q1. What is multiprocessing in Python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability of a program to create and run multiple processes concurrently. Each process runs independently and can utilize multiple CPU cores, enabling parallel execution of tasks. Multiprocessing is useful for improving the performance of CPU-bound tasks and taking advantage of modern multi-core processors."

    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing involves running multiple processes concurrently, each with its own memory space, while multithreading involves running multiple threads within the same process, sharing the same memory space.\n",
    "Processes in multiprocessing are more isolated and can avoid issues like race conditions, but they have higher memory overhead compared to threads.\n",
    "Multithreading is more suitable for I/O-bound tasks where threads can perform other tasks while waiting for I/O operations, while multiprocessing is more suitable for CPU-bound tasks that can benefit from parallel processing."

It is used to parallelize the execution of a function across multiple input values. The pool manages the creation and management of worker processes, allowing the programmer to focus on the task logic rather than the process management."
