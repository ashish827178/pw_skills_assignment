    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Traditional web hosting involves hosting a website on a single server, which can be limited in terms of scalability and reliability. Cloud hosting, on the other hand, involves hosting a website on a network of virtual servers that are managed by a cloud provider. Cloud hosting offers scalability, reliability, and flexibility, allowing users to pay for only the resources they use."

    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "To integrate a machine learning model with the user interface for the Algerian Forest Fires project, you can use APIs or libraries such as Flask (for Python) to create a web API that serves predictions from the model. The frontend of the application can then make requests to this API to get predictions and display them to the user."
