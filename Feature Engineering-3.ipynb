    "Q1: What is Min-Max Scaling, and How is it Used in Data Preprocessing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Min-Max scaling is a data preprocessing technique used to rescale numerical features within a specific range, typically [0, 1]. It ensures that all the features have the same scale, preventing some features from dominating others in machine learning algorithms. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each feature, you determine the minimum (min) and maximum (max) values in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you scale each feature's values using the formula:\n",

    "\n",
    "The Unit Vector technique, also known as \"Normalization,\" is another method used for feature scaling. It scales features to have a magnitude of 1. It's particularly useful when you want to scale features but maintain their direction. Here's how it differs from Min-Max scaling:\n",

    "In Min-Max scaling, you transform features to a specific range ([0, 1]), which changes both their magnitude and direction.\n",

    "Q3: What is PCA (Principal Component Analysis), and How is it Used in Dimensionality Reduction?\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA, or Principal Component Analysis, is a dimensionality reduction technique used in data analysis and machine learning. Its primary goal is to reduce the complexity of high-dimensional data while preserving as much relevant information as possible. PCA achieves this by transforming the original features into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components.\n",

    "\n",
    "Data Preparation: Start with a dataset containing multiple features or variables.\n",

    "Covariance Matrix: Calculate the covariance matrix of the standardized data. The covariance matrix represents the relationships between features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvalue Decomposition: Perform eigenvalue decomposition on the covariance matrix to find its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. These eigenvectors are the principal components, and the eigenvalues indicate their importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Select Principal Components: Sort the eigenvectors by their corresponding eigenvalues in descending order. The eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues capture the most variance in the data and are selected as the principal components.\n",

    "PCA (Principal Component Analysis) can be used as a technique for feature extraction, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data. The relationship between PCA and feature extraction lies in the ability of PCA to transform the original features into a new set of uncorrelated variables (principal components), effectively summarizing the information contained in the original features.\n",
