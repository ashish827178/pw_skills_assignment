    "A DataFrame in Pandas is a two-dimensional labeled data structure that resembles a table, where each column can have a different data type. It is one of the fundamental data structures provided by the Pandas library, and it allows us to store and manipulate data in a tabular form. A DataFrame can be thought of as a collection of Pandas Series, where each Series represents a column of the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Pandas Series, on the other hand, is a one-dimensional labeled array that can hold data of any type. It can be considered as a single column of data with an associated label, called the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between DataFrame and Pandas Series:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality: A DataFrame is a two-dimensional structure with both rows and columns, while a Pandas Series is a one-dimensional structure representing a single column or data array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Representation: In a DataFrame, we have multiple columns, and each column can have a different data type. In a Pandas Series, we have a single column with a consistent data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: DataFrames have both row and column indices, while Series have only a single index (row index).\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations: Many operations that we can perform on a DataFrame can also be applied to a Series, but DataFrame operations often involve manipulating entire columns or rows, whereas Series operations are more focused on the data within a single column.\n",
