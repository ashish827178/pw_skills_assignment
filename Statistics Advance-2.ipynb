    "Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "The PMF is used for discrete random variables, which take on distinct, countable values. The PMF assigns a probability to each possible value of the random variable. Mathematically, for a discrete random variable X, the PMF is denoted as P(X = x), where \"x\" is a specific value.\n",
